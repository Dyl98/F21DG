\section{Management Plan}
Due to the small size of the team a flat informal management system will be applied --- the overheads of any formal system would not yield any benefit to the project. Meetings between members and stakeholder(s) will be held regularly to ensure project success.

\section{Evaluation of Existing System}
We've evaluated the existing system and decided that we want to reuse, as much as possible, the existing application code. In particular we wish to reuse most of the GUI code to minimise changes to the end users. We do anticipate needing to refactor the existing code however, to improve maintainability and clarity. Similarly we have decided to redesign and implement the database component with only vague reference to the existing design, due to inadequacies in it.


\section{Requirements Specification}

\subsection{Purpose}
At a high level the primary purpose of the Workload Management System (WMS) is to facilitate the fair distribution of work within the department across staff members. Additionally it is to provide a transparent view of all work currently being carried out (and by whom) to all members of the department. To achieve this goal the WMS will enable staff members to record their existing and upcoming tasks, and provide an overview of the data. The system may also draw attention to situations when certain conditions are met, to assist administration of the department.

\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{subsec:Users}

There are three conceptual groups of users which will interact with the system. Note that any permissions (or lack thereof) detailed below are conditional on implementation of \autoref{freq:Permissions}.

\begin{enumerate}
\itempar Superuser/root\\
This group of users are responsible for maintaining and running the WMS software. They will have the ability to override or change any aspect of the system, and will be the only user (in principle) with direct database and server access. They will, whether directly or by proxy, have all of the permissions granted to the Administrator group in addition to their own.
\itempar Administrator\\
This group are those members of staff responsible for the assignment and management of tasks at a departmental (or similar) level. For example, the Head of School. These users will have permission to create, view, and edit any task within the system, however they will be constrained to use the WMS interface. They will also be the only users (alongside the Superuser by necessity) who will be able to view sensitive information.
\itempar Other Staff\\
Any member of staff within the MACS department who does not fall within one of the other 2 groups belong to this group. For example this may include, but is not limited to, Research Assistants, PhD Students, Lecturers, and Administrative Staff. This group will have the ability to view (but not edit) all tasks within the system. They will have the ability to create tasks to which they are assigned (in other words, to record in the system agreements made by external processes) and edit these -- and only these -- tasks.

Note that as a consequence of this definition, all staff members of the MACS department are considered users of the system (either in this group, or another).
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Functional User Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=F-UR-\arabic*, series=functional]

\itempar \label{freq:RecordTasks}Record individual tasks\\
Priority: Must Have\\

\begin{enumerate}[label*=.\arabic*]
\itempar \label{freq:GenericDetails}Recording of generic task details\\
	\textul{Priority: Must Have}\\
	For every new task created the appropriate data must be recorded, and no task will be recorded which fails to meet the minimum requirements. These requirements as follows:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
	\item Name
	\item General Text Description
	\item Task Classification (See \autoref{freq:TaskClassification})
	\item One or more Assigned Staff Members (See \autoref{freq:StaffAssignment})
	\item Estimated Measure of Workload
	\item Timespan over which the task will be carried out (See \autoref{freq:Scheduling})
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Specific task classifications may require the recording of additional data.




\itempar \label{freq:TaskClassification}Classification of Tasks\\
	\textul{Priority: Must Have}\\
	Tasks recorded in the system must be assigned one and only one of the following classifications:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
	\item Teaching
	\item Research
	\item Administrative
	\item External Activity
	\item Other Authorised Engagement
	\end{enumerate}

	No classifications outside of those listed here should be used.


\itempar Recording of teaching task details\\
	\textul{Priority: Must Have}\\
	In addition to the details required in \autoref{freq:GenericDetails}, teaching tasks require and must not be stored without the following details:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
		\item Course Code (For example, F29LP)
		\item Course Co-ordinator. The single member of staff principally responsible for delivering the course.
		\item Number of students participating in the course
	\end{enumerate}


\itempar Recording of research task details\\
	\textul{Priority: Must Have}\\
	In addition to the details required in \autoref{freq:GenericDetails}, research tasks require and must not be stored without the following details:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
		\item State of funding -- either Funded or Unfunded (and not both)
		\item Principal Investigator. The single member of staff principally responsible for carrying out the research.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
\itempar \label{freq:StaffAssignment} Assignment of staff to tasks\\
	\textul{Priority: Must Have}\\
	For any given task it must be possible to assign it to one or more staff members. It must also be possible to remove staff from any given task, except where that member of staff is the only one assigned to it. Where only one member of staff is assigned to a task, removal of that member of staff is as yet undefined behaviour and must be considered \textul{unsupported}.
	
	For every assignment of a staff member to a task, there must be an associated percentage denoting to what degree the staff member contributes to the overall work of the task. The sum of staff member contributions for any given task must not exceed 100\%. The sum of contributions is permitted to be less than 100\%, however this should be considered a degenerate case (see \autoref{freq:PercentageCondition}). 
	No staff member is permitted to have a contribution of 0\% to any task.
	
	
\itempar \label{freq:Scheduling}Scheduling of tasks\\
	\textul{Priority: Must Have}\\
	Every task must have a start date specified. If applicable, a task may also have an end date. Where a task does not have an end date specified it must be considered to continue in perpetuity. Where an end date is specified, the task may optionally repeat after some time interval -- for example, annually. The start and end dates, and any repetition must be able to be changed at any time.
\end{enumerate}

\itempar \label{freq:EditTasks}Editing and Deletion of tasks\\
	\textul{Priority: Must Have}\\
	It must be possible to edit the details of any given task at any time. It must also be possible to delete tasks from the system at any time. Editing, and particularly deleting, tasks may be subject to restrictions to maintain data or organisational integrity where necessary.

\itempar Access control\\
Priority: Variable\\
Highest Priority: Must Have\\

\begin{enumerate}[label*=.\arabic*]
\itempar Restrict access to authorised users only\\
	\textul{Priority: Must Have}\\
	Access to the application must be controlled, such that only authorised users can access it. In general, any staff member of the MACS department (and only of the MACS department) is considered an authorised user. This does not preclude other persons outwith the department being granted access, nor persons within the department being denied access. The mechanics of granting or denying specific persons access is an organisational and technical implementation detail outwith the scope of this document.
	
\itempar \label{freq:Permissions}Variable permissions levels for users\\
	\textul{Priority: Should Have}\\
	The ability of any given user to perform operations within the system should be limited inline with their responsibilities within the department. More specifically, users and their permissions should be limited as defined in \autoref{subsec:Users}.
	
\itempar Use of existing authentication mechanisms\\
	\textul{Priority: Could Have}\\
	If possible, the system could have the ability to utilise an existing authentication mechanism used within the university -- for example, the MACS departmental login. Depending on the functionality afforded by any such mechanism, that mechanism may become the only used within the system.


\end{enumerate}


\itempar Recording of staff details\\
	\textul{Priority: Must Have}\\
	In order that they may usefully be assigned to tasks (as per \autoref{freq:StaffAssignment}), the following details should be recorded for all users:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
	\item Name
	\item Office Number
	\item Email address
	\item Telephone Extension Number
	\item Campus
	\end{enumerate}
	
	This data must be able to be edited at any time.



\itempar Grouping of staff members\\
	\textul{Priority: Could Have}\\
	The system could support the grouping of staff members to mirror the organisation of the department. For example, by research interest or by department within a school.

\itempar Notification of degenerate or noteworthy conditions\\
Priority: Variable\\
Highest Priority: Should Have\\

\begin{enumerate}[label*=.\arabic*]

\itempar Reporting tasks nearing completion\\
	\textul{Priority: Should Have}\\
	Users should be notified when tasks they are assigned to are nearing completion. Such notifications could also be shown to Admin users.
	
\itempar Reporting exceptional individual loads\\
	\textul{Priority: Should Have}\\
	Admin users should be notified when members of staff have workloads above or below the departmental average, where the workload exits variance. This notification may also include fixed limits which are not defined relative to the departmental average.

\itempar Reporting imbalances in an individual's task classifications\\
	\textul{Priority: Should Have}\\
	Admin users should be notified when the distribution of a user's time between Teaching, Research, and Administrative tasks exceeds acceptable limits. For example, if a user spends a disproportionate amount of time on Research tasks compared to teaching and administration.

\itempar \label{freq:PercentageCondition}Reporting under-assigned tasks\\
	\textul{Priority: Should Have}\\
	Admin users should be notified when the total percentage contribution of users to a given task does not equal 100\%.
	
\itempar Suppression of notifications\\
	\textul{Priority: Could Have}\\
	Users could have the ability to suppress notifications such that ongoing situations, or exceptions to the established rules, do not dilute the value of the notifications overall. An excessive number of notifications could cause users to disregard all notifications. Conversely users may forget and fail to deal with situations after suppressing notifications(s). As such, the extent to which notifications can be suppressed, if at all, must be decided through experimentation and consequently is out of scope for this document.

\end{enumerate}


\itempar Planning view\\
	\textul{Priority: Should Have}\\
	 The system should provide to admin users a 'planning view', allowing them to carry out \autoref{freq:RecordTasks} and \autoref{freq:EditTasks} without the changes being visible to other users in order to plan for the future. Tasks created in this view will be subject to all of the same restrictions and notifications. There should also be the ability to 'import' all tasks from the main system view in the planning view, such that they can be edited in isolation without affecting the main view of the system or other non-admin users. 



\itempar Overview of assigned tasks\\
	\textul{Priority: Must Have}\\
	The system must provide to all users a general overview of all assigned tasks. The exact data to be included is not specified, however the following are suggested and given as examples:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
	\item A bar chart of the workloads of individual staff members to allow easy visual identification of outliers.
	\item A pie chart of the distribution of work between different task classifications for a given user. This may also be aggregated over a group of users.
	\item A line chart showing the anticipated future workload for an individual. This may also show multiple users, either as multiple lines on the chart or in aggregation.
	\end{enumerate}

\itempar Support of multiple languages\\
	\textul{Priority: Will Not}\\
	The system will not support multiple languages. The system should support Unicode, however the interface will be in English only.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non-Functional User Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=NF-UR-\arabic*, series=functional]

\itempar Academic date system\\
\underline{\smash{Priority: Should Have}}\\
The date system used within WMS should be based upon the academic year, rather than the calendar (or any other) year system.

\itempar \label{nfreq:Browsers} Supported browsers\\
    \textul{Priority: Must Have}\\
    The system must be accessible and functional for end users using either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. Other browsers may work, but are not explicitly supported.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Risk Analysis}

The risks identified in this section should be quantified with respect to the following impact matrix:

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabulary}{\textwidth}{l|l|l|l|l|l}
	 &\multicolumn{5}{c}{Consequence}\\ \cmidrule{2-6}
	Likelihood & Trivial & Minor & Moderate & Major & Severe \\ \midrule
	Almost Certain & Low & High & High & Extreme & Extreme \\
	Likely & Low & Moderate & High & High & Extreme \\
	Possible & Low & Moderate & Moderate & High & Extreme \\
	Unlikely & Low & Moderate & Moderate & High & High \\
	Rare & Low & Low & Moderate & Moderate & High \\
\end{tabulary}
\end{table}

Extreme risks are those requiring immediate corrective action. High risk issues require some immediate mitigation, and may require investigation leading to additional corrective actions. Moderate risks will benefit from adaptations or adjustments to mitigate consequence or likelihood, but do not require immediate action. Low risk items are either considered acceptable occurrences, or can be adequately dealt with as and when they arise.

The following risks have been identified (see next page):

\begin{landscape}
\begin{tabulary}{1.8\textwidth}{L|L|l|l}
	Risk & Mitigation & Likelihood & Consequences \\\toprule
	A team member falls ill & Keep group members up to date on current work in progress, and keep this work accessible & Unlikely & Moderate\\
	Loss of data & Back up work regularly to an external version control server/service. Ensure that there is always at least 2 copies of any data and those copies are not co-located either physically or virtually. & Rare & Major \\
	Failure to implement main features in time available & Weekly progress meetings with stakeholder(s) to ensure the project is on track. Triaging features if necessary to ensure a minimum-viable product is delivered & Possible & Moderate \\
	Change of requirements & Regular meetings with stakeholder(s) to ensure changes are communicated as early as possible & Likely & Moderate \\
	Insufficient time for thorough testing & Test software continuously during development as new features are implemented (unit and integration testing) & Possible & Moderate \\
	Major issue arising after delivery & Extensive acceptance testing by the end users prior to handover, and continuous testing during development & Possible & Major \\
	UCU members strike & Ensure that all required data is accessible without reliance on members of the UCU. University facilities have been maintained during previous strike action, and with no related teaching being delivered, impact is trivial & Almost Certain & Trivial \\ 
	Severe weather preventing travel & Ensure mechanisms are in place for communication and data sharing across the internet & Rare & Minor \\
	Expected hosting environment is insufficient & Develop and continually test the software in the intended hosting environment. Identify early any inadequacies and discuss resolutions with stakeholder(s) & Rare & Major \\

\end{tabulary}

\end{landscape}

\section{Test Plan}

\subsection{Scope}
\subsubsection{In Scope}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Unit tests for each new feature that is added.
    \item Systems and integration test for each new feature.
    \item Test that the system can function on a range of devices with different resolutions.
    \item Test the system on various browsers, focusing on those listed in \autoref{nfreq:Browsers}.
    \item Test the system for basic security flaws such as cross site scripting and SQL injection.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Out of Scope}
These features will not be tested due to be out with the requirements of the project.


\begin{itemize}
  \item Stress test. Not necessary as only the MACS department will be using this.
  \item Advanced security testing, e.g denial of service attacks.
  \item Performance of the system. This is something that we will be monitoring throughout the implementation but not explicitly testing it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test Methodology}
The test methodology that we will be adopting for this project is the agile methodology. We are using agile so that the system can be thoroughly tested throughout the implementation process. Due to only having two people as part of this team we will be carrying out a lot of these tests as we go. Before a new feature is added to the system we will each test it to make sure it doesn't disrupt the flow of the current system. Once we have implemented the entire system we will rerun our test plan over the entire system. During the implementation of the system we will also be conducting code reviews to make sure that the code used in the final system is properly written and commented.

\subsubsection{Test Levels}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Unit testing: Testing the individual components (e.g. functions, database queries) that comprise the new feature.
  \item Integration testing: Conducted when a new feature is added to the system to check that the new feature doesn't disrupt the current flow of the system.
  \item System testing: Conducted on the completed system to check if all of the requirements have been met and there are no major issues with the completed system.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Bug Triage}
When there is an issue detected during testing we will add this new issue as a new ticket in GitHub. This ticket should have a sensible title and a complete description of what the problem was and how to recreate it. Tickets will only be raised for issues found in the master branch.

\subsection{Test Deliverables}
Below is a list of each deliverable that will be provided during each stage of development.
\subsubsection*{Before Testing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Test plan
    \item Evaluation strategy
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{During Testing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Test data
    \item Test scenarios
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{After Testing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Final test results
    \item Release notes
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation Strategy}
\subsection{Introduction}
The point of the evaluation is to get user feedback on the design and the feel of the system. The evaluation will be conducted once near the end of the development process to check with the stakeholder(s) if it is what they envisioned, and that it meets acceptable usability levels.

\subsection{Evaluation Methodology}
\subsubsection{Aims}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Brief each participant
    \item Gather data on the usability of the product
    \item Record any critical flaws about the design and functionality of the product that arise 
    \item Debrief each participant
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Hypothesis}
The participant can complete a given scenario with ease and with no help from a third party.
\subsubsection{Participants}
The desired participants are those who will, upon completion, be using the system as part of their regular work activities. We aim to have a representative sample of all anticipated users in the MACS department participating.
