The database should use unicode (duh)

Is there an existing staff database we can use?

Should the primary key for the staff members table be their MACS username (if using LDAP)?


Should the start/end date of a super task contrain sub-tasks, or should the super-dates be derived from the sub-dates?

If the task can repeat, should the end-date define when it stops repeating, or should it be ignored in such a case?

Should server have a log file, to record which users changed what?

Should we support having a workload percentage of 0, to record users who have a stake in a task (or are 'task-owners') but don't actually contribute work? Should this be modelled separately?
