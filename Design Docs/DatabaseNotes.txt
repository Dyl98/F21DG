The database should use unicode (duh)

Is there an existing staff database we can use?

Should the primary key for the staff members table be their MACS username (if using LDAP)?

If staff members are assigned to a sub-task, the application must ensure that the total workload percentage equals 100% for all tasks in the sub- and super-trees
	IE If a new staff member is assigned to a sub task, the super task percentage attribution must change to support this.
	Application could force percentages to be added only to concrete sub-tasks or auto-update percentages with changes. The former is *somewhat* neater for the DB as it reduces the amount of (redundant) data being stored that could instead be calculated as needed.
	
Should the start/end date of a super task contrain sub-tasks, or should the super-dates be derived from the sub-dates?

If the task can repeat, should the end-date define when it stops repeating, or should it be ignored in such a case?

Should server have a log file, to record which users changed what?

Should we support having a workload percentage of 0, to record users who have a stake in a task (or are 'task-owners') but don't actually contribute work? Should this be modelled separately?
