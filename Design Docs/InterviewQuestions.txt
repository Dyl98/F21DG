Will administrative staff need a login -- IE will staff require access who have no tasks assigned to them in the system?
Will staff who do not have a MACS departmental login (different from the university-wide login used for email etc) require access? -- This will require us to store passwords and limit usefulness of LDAP

What meta-data, if any, should be recorded for staff members? (eg email, room number, campus, website, hair colour)

Would you prefer to organise tasks by date (DD/MM/YYYY) or by term (Semester 1; Christmas break; Semester 2; etc)?
Should tasks be able to repeat -- if so, in what ways (Annually, Bi-Annually, Weekly etc)?
Should the system support historical data?


What types of task should be recorded?
	How granular should the data be -- EG specific 'task-type' for Research Grants vs other Research duties?
		Should these be recorded in a hierarchy?
	How should tasks be grouped (Ie what task-types will we have)?
		Could a given task (eg F29LP) fall under multiple goups? eg both administrative (marking) and teaching (lecturing)?
	Can a given task comprise of multiple sub-tasks (potentially of different task-types)?
		Should sub-tasks be able to have different start and end dates, within the confines of the top-level task?
	What data should be recorded for a task?
		What sort of meta-data should be (uniquely) recorded for specific task types -- For example details of the funding source for research grants?


What user stories are there? What do you want to be able to do.



Do we want to colour code task types? If so, should we store this display data in the DB (probably)
